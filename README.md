- I’m @CountFlandy, a 26 year old who's just trying to get his footing.
- I’m really interested in history, though usually you can find me at home behind my desk playing some game.
- Currently learning C#, though I'm open to more in the future as I get my footing in C#.
- I’m mostly looking to make small things to expand my skills, though I'm open to suggestions and collabs.
- If you need to reach me you can find me most places, typically I'm "Count Flandy" everywhere.
