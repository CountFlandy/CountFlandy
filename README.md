- I’m @CountFlandy, a 27 year old who's just trying to get his footing.
- I'm experienced in C#, and currently am working on small projects to pad my portfoilo.
- I’m mostly looking to make small things to expand my skills, though I'm open to suggestions and collabs.
- If you need to reach me you can find me most places, typically I'm "Count Flandy" everywhere.
